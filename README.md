# DeveLanCacheUI_Backend
A UI for Lan Cache.

** Important Upgrade Guide**

As of version 1.0.57 you need to migrate to a new Docker-Compose.yml. Here's how:

Note: Also add the DNS line if you errors in the container logs that it can't get the manifests due to a 401 unauthorized

## Screenshots

Can show Steam Games that were downloaded / cached:

Can show other Download events:

Can show client / service stats:

## How to run this

docker-compose.yml:

```
version: '3'

services:
  develancacheui_backend:
    image: devedse/develancacheui_backend:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '7301:80'
    environment:
      - LanCacheLogsDirectory=/var/develancacheui/lancachelogs
      - DeveLanCacheUIDataDirectory=/var/develancacheuidata
      - ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=Data Source={DeveLanCacheUIDataDirectory}/database/develancacheui.db;
      - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
      - LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
    volumes:
      - "/home/pi/dockercomposers/develancacheui/backend:/var/develancacheuidata"
      - "/mnt/mynas/DockerComposers/lancache/logs:/var/develancacheui/lancachelogs:ro"
    dns:
      - 10.88.20.254
  develancacheui_frontend:
    image: devedse/develancacheui_frontend:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '7302:80'
    environment:
      - BACKENDURL=https://develancacheui_api.devedse.duckdns.org
```

Update the docker-compose.yml with your own URL's. Changing the TZ and LANG only impact the way the container logs. (E.g. 23/04/2023 instead of 04/23/2023)

Steps:
1. Create/mount the relevant directories
2. Run the docker-compose file
3. Copy paste the app-depot-output.csv file in the mounted `depotdir`. This will automatically fill the database with all Depot => App mappings (Grab here: https://github.com/devedse/DeveLanCacheUI_SteamDepotFinder_Runner/releases)

5. Profit

## How it works

DeveLanCacheUI_Backend starts by reading through the whole access.log file generated by LanCache.
Besides processing the whole existing access.log file, it will also 'watch' the file for new log lines.
All log lines that were already processed before are skipped.
It parses every line and tries to create "DownloadEvents". A download event is an event that starts at a specific point in time and ends.
Download events are separated/grouped by a unique identifier: clientIp, service, downloadIdentifier (some unique identifier, e.g. DepotId for Steam. Not all services have this)
All new log lines that happen within 5 minutes of the last update of the download event with the same unique identifier will be grouped.

Let's say at 00:00 we start downloading CounterStrike on steam. A unique identifier is made: 192.168.2.123,steam,2347771
If a new log entry with the same unique identifier is found, it's searching the db for past event that were updated in the last 5 minutes.
If that's the case, this log entry is appended to the existing download event.

This results in download events being specific instances of a certain client download a certain application/update/game.

## Issue: My access.log file is updated but my DeveLanCacheUI_Backend isn't reading the new lines

So apparently if the access.log file is in a SMB Share which is mounted in docker (as is the case for me) the DeveLanCacheUI_Backend application takes a READ lock on the share. This apparently lets CIFS decide that no other applications will write to this file which allows it to cache things.
If you manually execute the `ls` command in the lancachelogs directory it will in fact start reading the file again.

To work around this issue you need to add `cache=none` to the CIFS mount in `/etc/fstab`:
```
//192.168.2.201/DockerComposers /mnt/mynas/DockerComposers cifs credentials=/home/pi/.mynascredentialssmb,iocharset=utf8,vers=3.0,sec=ntlmssp,cache=none 0 0
```
